# Course organization

## Why a degree project?

The purpose is to provide a unique and challenging opportunity for the student
to practice a variety of skills that are required for a successful professional
career.

Specifically, the degree project trains the student to:

* integrate acquired understandings and learnings with past knowledge,
* independently perform systematic and scientific work
* apply critical thinking
* communicate results in an understandable, efficient, mature and correct way

## Core components

The degree project compromises several key components:

* **Problem solving**: each project is developed around a specific [research question](../project-specification/research-question) that
generates a problem that should be scientifically addressed by the student.
* **Literature studies**: the answer to the problem is put in context of the current scientific knowledge and theories.
* **Scientific writing**: the problem, context, and solution is presented and discussed in a scientific report.
* **Oral presentation**: the project and its results are presented and defended in public.
* [**Peer-reviewing**](peer-reviewing.md): the student takes an active role in
learning from and providing feedback to other students' works.

## People
During the degree project you will meet people with different roles:

* **Student**: You are already an expert in multiple fields, a problem solver,
capable of integrating information from different sources and fields,
and with knowledge of science theory and methods.
* **Coordinator**: Academic staff at KTH. Manages assignment of projects to
supervisors and examiners. Schedules presentations and oppositions.
* **Examiner**: Academic staff at KTH (often professor). Approves the [project specification](../project-specification/purpose) and examines the final report
and presentation. Typically examines multiple theses during the same course.
* **Academic supervisor**: Staff at KTH. Supervises multiple theses. Runs
group meetings. Provides support on thesis management. Reduces the examiner's work
load by assuring that the thesis fulfills the academic requirements.
* **Supervisor at principal's place**: Provides expertise to solve the problem.
* **Peer-students**

## Process
The degree project counts for 30 credits (20 weeks). It includes:

* individual work (project preparation, literature studies, thesis work and writing),
* individual and group meetings with academic supervisor,
* attendance to seminars,

## Group meetings
A group consists of one academic supervisor and typically four to six students.
They meet regularly throughout the course. The purpose of the group meetings is
to:

* provide information and help the student throughout the project
* make efficient use of resources, advice and experiences (good and bad ones)
with each other. Many of the problems that the students encounter are general
and can be solved together.
* increase the quality of each other's projects
* evenly distribute the project work load over time (e.g. using assignments)
* break the isolation that may come with the project
* indirectly and directly prepare for oral presentation (we talk, describe, defend ideas and thoughts on  our projects)
* gain confidence as writers (by seeing how other experience and handle a similar
process)
* inspire each other

## Evaluation and grade criteria

Different grading system are applied in the [different degree project courses](https://www.kth.se/social/group/examensarbete-vid-cs/page/courses-and-course-codes-for-degree-proj/).

| Grading system     | Course codes           |
| :----------------: | ---------------------- |
| **Pass/Fail**      | [DA221X, DA222X, DA223X](https://www.kth.se/social/group/examensarbete-vid-cs/page/da221x-da222x-da223x-evaluation-form/)|
| **A - F**          | [DA224X, DA225X, DA226X](https://www.kth.se/social/group/examensarbete-vid-cs/page/da224x-da225x-da226x-grading-criteria/)|

**DA[221,222,223]X:** [Assessment components](https://www.kth.se/social/group/examensarbete-vid-cs/page/da221x-da222x-da223x-evaluation-form/) are evaluated against the [KTH objectives](https://intra.kth.se/polopoly_fs/1.661631!/Comprehensive%20guidelines%20for%20degree%20project%20courses%2C%20common%20goals%20and%20assessment%20criteria%20%28applies%20from%2001.07.2015%29.pdf). They include:

* Report
* Oral presentation
* Written opposition
* Oral opposition
* Peer-feedback / review
* Specification
* Execution of specification
* Autonomy and supervision
* Attendance at two seminars

**DA[224,225,226]X**: Three separate areas are evaluated:
(**process**, **engineering & academic content**, and **presentation**), and
each area is graded with MHK (very high quality), HK (high quality),
P (pass), or F (fail). They together determine the final course grade.
