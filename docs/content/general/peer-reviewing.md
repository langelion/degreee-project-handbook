# Peer reviewing

This section describes general ideas on peer-reviewing in the context of
the degree project.

!!! note "REMEMBER"
    "Att samarbeta på det här sättet kräver en del av dem som ska vara med.
    Om det blir så att bara några få tar det på allvar, medan andra betraktar
    denna arbetsform som en möjlighet att på ett lättvindligt sätt skaffa sig en
    examen, blir det problematiskt. Det är oerhört viktigt att man skapar grupper
    där man känner att man får något tillbaka, samtidigt som man känner att man själv
    kan komma med vettiga bidrag."

## Purpose
The peer-review process is aimed to improve the students' skills on:

* critical reading
* scientific writing
* giving and receiving criticism

Above are all **invaluable skills**, no matter what the student end up doing
after graduation.

In addition, the peer-reviewing process is aimed to indirectly enhance the
students' comprehension of the [evaluation criteria](./course-organization#evaluation-and-grade-criteria).

A desired outcome of the peer-reviewing process is that the quality of the reviewed
texts increase significantly.

## Types of feedback
**READER-BASED**: How do you as a reader feel and react on the text?

**KNOWLEDGE-BASED**: For example, are the methods correctly described and used?

**CRITERIA-BASED**: How well does the assignment agree with the evaluation criteria?

**WRITING-BASED**: There are many aspects of scientific writing that can and should
be reviewed, including:

* **content**: has the text a clear focus? Is the current text relevant for that focus?
* **structure and composition**: is the text appropriately divided into clear and consequent sections? Do section titles help to create structure, connections, and understanding?
* **integration of knowledge and theories**: are there any clarifying examples of theories and concepts? Are they helpful for understanding?
* **selection and implementation of methods**,
* **use of references**,
* **reasoning**,
* **novelty and creativity**,
* **terminology and language**: correct and consequent use? definition of abbreviatons?

## Constructive feedback
Feedback should be **constructive**. Aim to:

* highlight the text's strong/good parts
* express what is not clear or what concepts and descriptions are difficult to understand,
* suggest a direction for any unfinished parts
* inspire the author to improve the text

## The feedback process
Below is a general **suggestion** on how to approach peer-reviewing tasks.

<u>Before reading:</u>

* Identify the aspects of the assignment that should be addressed in the text.
* Try to completely **neglect** who is the author of the text you will comment on.

<u>First reading:</u>

* What is your spontaneous feeling about it?
* Can you identify the text's strength and weakness?

<u>Repeated reading:</u>

* Read slowly and carefully. Meanwhile, **comment on anything** that gets your attention (good and bad).
* When finished, categorize your draft comments (e.g. content, structure, language, references, ... [see above](#types-of-feedback))
* Prioritize the comments within each of your categories. Decide which comments are most important to address in order to improve the text?
* Suggest improvements/changes for your most important comment(s).
* Check and complete any task-specific peer-reviewing instructions.

<u>Afterwards</u>

Ask yourself:

* would your comments/suggestions potentially influence the first-impression reading?
* are your comments clear and well-argued?
* are your comments free from any personal reference?
* is there anything in the reviewed text that you could apply to your own assignment text?
* do you fulfill the recommendations listed below ([tips](#tips))

## Tips

!!! tip "Create a win-win situation"
    Take the peer-reviewing feedback **seriously**. If you return highly thought-through comments
    to your peer-author, you

    1. have acquired valuable experience in scientific writing,
    2. will inspire her/him to immerse in the next peer-reviewing task.

    It is a win-win situation.

!!! note "REMEMBER"
    We are all sensible when it comes to receive feedback on our work.

    In this course, the reviewed texts often contain unfinished thoughts
    and content. Don't feel uncomfortable about that.

!!! note "REMEMBER"
    As a peer-reviewer you are a **reader**, not an evaluator.


!!! note
    As an author, do not hesitate to request specific feedback from your peer-reviewers
    on sections that you feel insecure about or have trouble to develop.

!!! note "KNOWLEDGE-BASED feedback"
    Although not the main focus for the peer-reviewing tasks, we cannot overlook
    the fact that many theses touch on similar topics. Feel free to comment on
    choice of methods, their implementation and application **if appropriate**.

!!! warning
    Avoid feedback that is vague, generic, negative, or intimidating

!!! warning
    Avoid to focus on small grammatical issues (except for the very final report).
