# Writing the pre-study

The writing is the last part of the pre-study. However, first of all <span style="background-color:yellow">it is highly recommended that the notes taken during the [literature review stage](./literature-review.md) are
used to build a **rough draft** that outlines the structure and core content of the
pre-study</span>. If doing so, the actual writing becomes a question of extending, rewriting,
restructuring, and rethinking the draft material trying to turn it into
a coherent argument that clearly justifies the research question and the choice of methods to answer it.

## Who is the reader?
Before starting to write one should also **identify the target audience**.
For the degree project, the target readers include:

1. examiner
2. academic supervisor
3. supervisor at the principal
4. fellow students
5. other potential readers interested in the topic.

<span style="background-color:yellow">The level on the written content should be
a compromise between the author and the readers' level of knowledge</span>.

## Structure
There is no template or one-must-follow structure for the pre-study. Nevertheless,
for the purpose of the final report it is recommended to start with a general
introduction of the context, followed by an exposition of the necessary theory
(background), then a recapitulation of the related work (i.e. state-of-the-art
for the research area) and finally a summary that justifies the proposed
methodology to answer the research question.

**Introduction to research area** -> **Theory** -> **Related work** -> **Summary** -> (**References**)

The two first parts (introduction and theory) are typically more general, while
the two last parts are very specific to each degree project.

with a recapitulation of the main points covered and the take-home messages.
In between, it is important to develop a logical structure that guides the reader
along the concepts and ideas.

### Introduction

* Introduce the reader to the field of research. If the degree project is of
interdisciplinary nature, it is necessary to give background on all involved fields.
* Why is this general area of research significant / important / interesting?
* Provide a birds-eye view on the subject(s) before "zooming in" on the particular
topics that will be investigated.
* Any limitations (e.g. have any topics been excluded)?

### Theory
* Identify the fundamental concepts of the underlying theory.
* The author has to find a compromise of how much theory is necessary in order
for the [reader](#who-is-the-reader) to follow the argument.
* While the author has to understand the theory in detail, the reader should be
able to use this section to learn the fundamental concepts of the the theory and
find the appropriate references in the text to explore the theory alone.
* There is no purpose to extend this section only to increase the number of pages
of the report.

### State-of-the-art

In general, <span style="background-color:yellow">a good review of the state-of-the-art
does not only summarize the literature, but discusses it critically, identifies methodological
problems, and points out research gaps</span>. A common structure for the state-of-the-art is:

1. Short summary of the historically most important advances in the field up to today (How has thinking in this area evolved over time?).
2. Which are the best solutions to solve the problem described?
3. Why are the proposed solutions not enough to solve the current problem?
Identify the **knowledge gap** that the project will address.
4. Finally, put the planned research into perspective of what has been discussed
up to this point. What are the grounds for believing that the research
hypotheses are likely to be true and worth investigating?

### Summary
* What are the major findings of the pre-study?
* In context of what has been discussed, <span style="background-color:yellow">
finish the pre-study by justifying the methodology that will be used to answer
the research question</span>.

### References

* Use a [reference manager](literature-search#reference-management) to handle
your references and to dynamically generate the list of references.
* There exist several [different citation styles](http://www.citethisforme.com/guides)
that one can use (e.g. APA, Harvard, Vancouver, etc). The most important is
that one is consequent throughout the text.
