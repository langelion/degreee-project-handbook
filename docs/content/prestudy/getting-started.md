    * [Find, Evaluate & Cite!](https://www.kth.se/en/biblioteket/kalender/find-evaluate-cite-1.867599?date=2019-02-14&orgdate=2019-01-27&length=1&orglength=0)
    * [Reference Management Software-Basic Introduction](https://www.kth.se/en/biblioteket/kalender/arc-workshops/reference-management-software-basic-introduction-1.867603?date=2019-02-21&orgdate=2019-01-27&length=1&orglength=0)
* **Search**
    * If a "seed" paper exists, start to search using [**citation chaining**](./literature-search.md#citation-chaining). Go both backward and forward in the citation chain.
    * Search systematically using **multiple and different keywords**. It is
    important to try to capture as many ways as possible to express an idea.
    * Use [different databases](#databases).
    * Keep track of the used search terms (so the search can be reproduced if needed).
    * Aim to browse through **large** amounts of papers. It is perfectly normal to
    explore ten times as many papers as will be included in the final literature report.
    * Keep a list of literature that could not be retrieved (e.g. due to paywall).
    Consult with the library / the supervisor.
    * Schedule a least 20 hours to do the literature search and initial skimming of papers for relevance.
* **Read**
    * While reading, take notes. Write down interesting pieces of information,
    insights about how to organize your pre-study, thoughts on what to write, etc.
    * Use a [reference manager](#reference-management) from the very beginning.
    * Use quotation marks if you are provisionally copying verbatim from the literature into your notes.
* **Write**
    * Start with a draft to build a coherent structure towards a logical argument.
    * Initially focus on the latter sections (state-of-the-art, summary)
    * Write only when the idea is clear.
