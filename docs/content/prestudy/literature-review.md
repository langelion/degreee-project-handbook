#Reviewing information

Before getting started with the pre-study it can easily seem like a tough mission
to read up on all the relevant literature. However, <span style="background-color:yellow">reading a scientific article is not the same as reading a normal textbook</span>. While the latter is
typically read from cover to cover, a research article is often divided into separate
sections that can be read separately (similar to how a normal newspaper is divided
into different sections). This division, in combination with clever
[search strategies](./literature-search.md#search-strategies), makes it easy to
efficiently browse large amounts of research literature in little time and to
build a core of **candidate papers** for the pre-study.

## Browsing literature
When browsing the literature, articles are skimmed through rather than read critically.
When skimming through a paper the reading is not linear. For example, the order
of reading could be:

1. **title**: What is the paper about?
2. **abstract**: provides a concise overview of the paper,
3. **introduction**: look for motivations, relation to other work, and a more detailed overview,
4. **conclusions**: What are the main result?
5. **overall structure of the paper**:
    * What do the remaining sections address?
    * What is new or different about this work?

If relevant, add the paper to your [reference manager software](./literature-search.md#reference-management) to not loose track of it. If at any point the research article is irrelevant for
the degree project, then discard it and move on to the next article.

## Reading research papers
When relevant papers have been identified they should be read carefully.

* Focus on the **body of the paper** (results, discussion) and pay attention to
the details.
* Take notes as you read. For each key paper, assess:
    * research question
    * key findings / arguments
    * supporting evidence / sample characteristics / methods
    * strengths / limitations
    * significance / implications
    * relevance
* Explore the references (for citation chaining search strategy).
