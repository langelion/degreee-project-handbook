# Pre-study

The pre-study (also known as reading stage, literature study, background study)
is the foundation of any scientific work. <span style="background-color: yellow">
Its purpose is to facilitate in-depth knowledge about the research topic
in order to contextualize the research question and support the approach
to address it</span>.

Specifically, the pre-study should:

* convince the reader that the research area is interesting, significant, and important,
* provide the historical context for the research area and showcase related work (**state-of-the-art**),
* explain and justify the choice of theoretical framework,
* demonstrate that the proposed research methods are sound and reasonable,
* introduce relevant terminology and provide definitions to clarify how terms are to be used.

In simple terms, the process is described by:

1. A thorough literature search.
2. A detailed review of selected research papers
3. Writing up necessary theory and state-of-the-art to justify the research.
