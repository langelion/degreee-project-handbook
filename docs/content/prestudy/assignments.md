* Which topics (sections) will be discussed around in the pre-study, and with what granularity?
* Which are the main sources that will be used for each section?

Report above to the academic supervisor in a simple and informal format (e.g. sections with bullet points).
Time dedication: about two weeks.

## Evaluation
The pre-study is presented in a written report. The report is structured so that
it can be recycled as a separate chapter in the final written report.

Criteria for the background section of the final report:
> The scientific field of work is well introduced. The background contains a
written review of previous research and development, and the student's own work
is designed in accordance with the conclusions of this review. Work related to
the state of the art of knowledge are described.
