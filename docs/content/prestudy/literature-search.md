# Literature search

The pre-study starts with a thorough literature search for information that:

1. make observations on the research problem,
2. document the need to answer the research question,
3. contain data related to the research question that can be analyzed and/or discussed,
4. describe models, methods, concepts that can be used to answer the research question.

Common sources of information are <i>full-text research articles</i>,
<i>review articles</i>, <i>conference proceedings</i>, <i>manuals</i>,
<i>textbooks</i>, <i>business reports</i>, <i>code libraries</i>, etc.

<span style="background-color: yellow">It is important that the sources are
valid and can be trusted.</span> For that purpose it is recommended to rely on
academic literature that has undergone thorough scientific revision.

## Academic literature
Most scientific literature is subject to a rigorous  **peer-review process**.
It means that academic articles are carefully reviewed by impartial experts in
the field. The peer reviewers are volunteers, and they help to ensure that the
article is meaningful and that the research is accurate and has been professionally
executed.

<span style="background-color: yellow">As a reader of a scientific text it is
good practice to check if the text has been subject to peer reviewing</span>.

### Access
Although research is often funded by public sources, academic literature is a
commercial business and access to scientific information often requires subscription
to the journals that publishes the research. <span style="background-color:yellow">
The university library provides access to most ([but not all](https://www.kth.se/biblioteket/nyheter/sverige-tar-stallning-for-oppen-tillgang-avtalet-med-elsevier-sags-upp-1.820029)) relevant scientific journals</span>.

To increase the access to knowledge, the scientific community has adopted principles
of **open-access**. Researchers who want to spread their work and make it publically
accessible basically have three options:

1. To pay an extra (but not insignificant) fee to the editorial in order to grant
 the research article open-access status (i.e. readers can bypass the subscription paywall).
2. To publish the research in truly open-access journal.
3. To deposit the research in open-access repositories.

The amount of high-quality peer-reviewed **open-access journals** is increasing
rapidly. While a subscription paywall typically means that a journal is serious
about peer-reviewing, open access journals are many times equally rigorous about
it. Nevertheless, the explosion of electronic journals has led to mass publication
of a large number of scientific articles with little or no peer review.



### Databases
There exist dedicated search engines and databases for scholary information.
All databases accessible via the KTH library are available [**here**](https://www.kth.se/biblioteket/soka-vardera/sok-information/databaser-och-soktjanster-1.851404).
They include,

* [**Web of Science**](http://focus.lib.kth.se/login?url=http://webofknowledge.com/):
a service provided by The Thomson Reuters Corporation that covers a broad range
of scientific discipline (including computer science). Access provided via the
KTH library.
* [**Google Scholar**](https://scholar.google.com): easy to use and has a wide
coverage. However, no clear criteria what makes its results "scholary".
* [**arXiv**](https://arxiv.org): open-access archive of scholarly articles that
not yet have been reviewed by experts (i.e. a repository of draft research articles).
* The [**directory of open access journal (DOAJ)**](https://doaj.org/) is a community-curated
online directory that indexes and provides access to high quality, open access,
peer-reviewed journals.

<span style="background-color:yellow">It is highly recommended to explore and
use a variety of databases since they have different conditions and content</span>.
 Often you get different citations in Google Scholar than in Web of Science.

Also, explore the [**DIVA database**](http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/search.jsf?dswid=6869) to read theses from previous years.
### Impact factors
Correct or not, scientific journals can be ranked by their **impact factor**
(IF). A higher value typically indicates that the journal publishes important and
relevant findings, that are often referred to (cited) by researchers in other
works. <span style="background-color:yellow">The journal's impact factor can be a
first indicator of how relevant a research article is</span>.

Briefly, the IF is calculated for a specific period of time (e.g. two years).
During that period,

**IF = (number of citations for recent articles) / (number of recent articles)**.

Note that not all journals have IFs (e.g., it takes two years for a new journal
to obtain its IF score), and the IF does **not** measure the true scientific
value of an individual article.  

The [**Journal Citation Reports (JCR)**](https://www.webofknowledge.com/JCR)
database lists IFs for thousands of journals. In addtion, scientific journals
usually publish their current IF score on their websites.

## Search strategies
There are <span style="background-color:yellow">two major search strategies</span>
that both should be explored during the degree project: <i>systematic search</i>
and <i>citation chaining</i>.

#### Systematic literature search

1. **Planning**: Define key search terms and research areas based on the
research question. Consider possible synonyms, related terms, abbreviations, etc.
2. **Select databases**: It is important to use [different databases](#databases).
3. **Search**: Explore different combinations of keywords and search terms
4. **Reflection**: Scan through search results. Pay attention to terms and vocabulary.
 Oftentimes one can find new but relevant search terms from the search results.
 If so, repeat from step three.
5. **Documentation**:  Document the searches so that they can be reproduced later if necessary.

#### Citation chaining

1. Start with a single paper ("seed" paper) that is close to the work and/or
that describes the topic particularly well.
2. Go **backward** in the citation chain by pulling all the relevant papers
cited within the "seed" paper.
3. To go **forward** in the citation chain, explore what other papers have cited
the "seed" paper.

**Advantage**: If the "seed" paper is good, this typically leads from one good
reference to another. It allows to follow how the arguments are built from
one study to another.

**Drawback**: One may miss out on parallel lines of research.

## Reference management
A dedicated digital database of your literature can be setup using tools like
[Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/), [JabRef](http://www.jabref.org/), [Endnote](http://endnote.com/),
[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), [Papers](http://www.readcube.com/papers/), [Qiqqa](http://www.qiqqa.com/)

The reference management software helps to import research articles from
academic databases into a private (online) repository. The import requires minimal
manual work, and new candidate papers can be easily added to the repository (drag/drop).
Importantly, the reference management software facilitates automated bibliography
and in-text citations for the report.
