Deliver engaging and informative oral presentations in English

1) Don't start with slides
  - What is your thesis statement? (a sentence that summarizes your argument)
  - Without that statement, you cannot make a good presentation
  - E.g. "The contact angles between sulphides and steel melt depend on the steel composition"

  - Who is your audience?
  - How long do you have to speak? Q&A?
  - What equipment is available? (Sound, video, etc)
  - Are you being graded? What are the criteria?

  2) Structure is EVERYTHING

    Introduction
    Method
    Results
    Discussion

    How to engage your audience? Five tips:

    A: Arouse your audience's attention
    R: Reject counterarguments (is there any reason why the audience is going to contradict my argument)
    G: Give evidence
    U: Urge understanding
    E: Ensure continued attention

3) Arouse your audience's attention

How can you capture attention?

Three ways to convince people:
1) Logic:
2) Credibility: give your background, what is your expertice? Try to be likable?
3) Emotion:

4) Reject counterarguments
Why might your audience not be interested in your presentation?
  - Tackle problems,
  - Offer new perspective,
  - Present novelty,

5) Give evidence
What facts, figures, examples, and references can you use to support every point you make?

Important to:
Make a POINT
Give EVIDENCE
EVALUATE the evidence

6) Urge understanding
What is your take-home message?
- Repeat your thesis statement
- Use metalanguage to highlight important ideas
  (
    "Something important to understand is...",
    "Let's remember that..."
  )

7) Ensure continued attention
