# Presentation

While initially perhaps frightening, oral presentation of papers can be an
exciting, exhilarating, efficient, and rewarding scientific activity.

The goal is to communicate science to your colleagues, whom you respect and who
respect you, as they certainly will when you are finished with your presentation.

## Keys to a successful presentation
A successful presentation requires **careful planning** and **clear structure**.
A common error is to start to prepare the slides for the presentation in
advance of having planned and structured the presentation.

### Planning
Start the planning early on. Collect ideas for the presentation already when
writing the report. Think about what needs to be argued and explained. Specifically,
it is recommended to think through the following aspects of the presentation:

**Define your objective** - *What do you want to achieve? What do you want your
audience to take away with them?**
Formulate your "Thesis statement", a sentence that summarizes your argument.

**Know your audience** - *How much will your audience already know about your
topic? How can you link new material to things they might already understand?*

**Venue** - *What equipment is available? (Sound, video, light, etc)*

**Remit** - *How long do you have to speak? Q&A? Are you being graded?
If so, what are the criteria?*

### Structure
Structure is EVERYTHING.

In contrast to the report, the structure of the presentation has more degrees
of freedom. It does not have to follow a particular order but can (and should)
be adapted to the speaker, content, and audience. Nevertheless, a common core
structure is as follows:

* **Introduction**: create interest and goodwill. ställ en fråga, presentera dig, gör ett påstående...
* **Background**: Utgångspunkter, "trailer" (layout), definitioner. Bli inte för långrandig
* **Main body**: argue, explain, inform, (adapt to content and situation)
* **Conclusion**: Summarize, reconnect to intro/background, look forward, give recommendations

That said, [**above core structure could basically be reversed**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy5H87w26Wc&feature=youtu.be), which typically leaves
more room for what is really important in the presentation.

No matter the structure, it is important that the audience is guided through
the content and that the speaker motivates WHY something is relevant, important,
or relevant.

<b>Tell them what you are going to tell them</b>: Arouse the audience's attention.
Connect to audience's knowledge and previous experience. Use logic, offer new
perspectives. Present novelty. What is your expertise? Try to be likable.

<b>Tell it to them</b>: Give evidence. <i>What facts, figures, examples, and
references can you use to support every point you make?</i>. It is Important
to make a POINT and evaluate the evidences.

<b>Tell them what you told them</b>: Reinforce the message. Urge understanding.

## Tips

* Select parts of the report to present. Avoid to pack too much into the talk.
Perhaps we do this out of insecurity, feeling that we have found out so little
to impress an audience that we need to make up for it in sheer volume.

* If you get a question from the opponent or the audience: it is often very good
to repeat the question so that everyone is aware of what have been asked.

* Prepare your equipment. Check that it works on site.
