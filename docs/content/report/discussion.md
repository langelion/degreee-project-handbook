# Report: Discussion

The Discussion section is **where the results are interpreted, and the foundation
for the conclusions are laid out**. Its purpose is very clear, namely to

* summarize the main findings
* put the findings into context by comparing with previous work,
* discuss future implications and any shortcomings of the research design.

## Content

The content of the Discussion section should assure that below questions can
be properly answered by reader:

* What was found?
* What was known before, and what is new?
* How does the new results fit in a broader picture? (Are the findings important?)
* Are the findings true? (Any limitation of the study?)
* What can be done with the findings?

The content of the Discussion therefore naturally has tight connection to the
content of both the [Introduction]() and the [Results section](results.md).

!!! note
    The discussion is **subjective**. A reader may have a different
    interpretation of the results than the author.

## Composition
There are no absolute rules how to write the Discussion. Nevertheless, its content
should be **systematically presented**.

While the Introduction starts broadly and then narrows down to the particular
research question, the Discussion typically starts with the narrowest part
(main findings) and then gradually widens out to comparisons with other studies
and the interpretation of the results in the wider context of the research topic.

<pre>
       Go from the general, broad context of your work,
           to tell the reader what is already known,
                to what is not yet known or,
                   what the problems are,
                     to what you have
                         decided
                          to do

                    Methods and results
    (i.e. the original part of the study = contribution)

                           After
                        summarizing
                    the results, identify
                   limitations and biases,
                 compare and contrast them
              with previous findings and discuss
          theoretical and practical implications of your
         own, make cautious speculations and suggest future
      research, show what is new and how your results fit into
  the broad field you described at the  beginning of the introduction
</pre>

## Tips

* Discuss one question at the time. Avoid jumping back and forth. Make the reader aware of where they are being led.

* For each point that is discussed, order simple to complex (building to conclusion).

* Remind the reader of the knowledge gap identified in the Introduction to re-spark
curiosity about the question you have set out to answer.

* Be frank about acknowledging limitations.

* Avoid to repeat results.

## Checklist

* The most important results have been emphasized and critically evaluated.

* The discussion section does not present new results.

* The findings are interpreted against the settings of the study (conditions and limitations)

* The findings are interpreted and discussed in a broader context, and connects
back to the existing literature.

* Statements and conclusions are well supported by the results.

* Conclusions are reasonable, concrete, and associates with objectives/research question.

* It is stated how the study fills the knowledge gap pointed out in the Introduction, and
how the results have moved the field forward.

* Each research question leads to new questions. The most relevant ones are mentioned.
