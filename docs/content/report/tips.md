!!! tip "Read, read, read"
    Spend significant time to find and read **high-quality literature** relevant for
    your research topic. It will help you to choose your methods and to narrow down
    your research question.

!!! tip "Learn from previous thesis works"
    Use the [library](https://www.kth.se/kthb) to find [published engineering master's theses](http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/search.jsf?dswid=-6704).
    Explore many theses, both in your own and in other fields.

    * What common structure do they all share?
    * Are the research questions stated implicitly or explicitly?
    * How have the students narrowed down their research question?
    * Focus on the introductory chapters. How do they relate to Assignment 1?

### Build structure
Figure out the different sections of the text.

Use the section titles to tell the story:
It should be possible to read out the idea of the thesis only from the table of contents

!!! tip "Writing is a continuous process"
    **A good project description is not written in one day.** It has to mature.
    Therefore, create a draft on the very first day, and then continuously edit it
    (add/remove/change/reconsider) until you hand it in.

!!! note
    "Finns det en underrubrik på en viss nivå i ett avsnitt, så bör det normalt finnas minst två (annars haltar trädstrukturen i dokumentet)."


## Final formatting

!!! tip "References"
    There are many ways to cite an article. Show different examples.
    In all cases, the citation should be included next to the text. Do
    "... blah blah [REF]", and not "... blah blah. [REF]"

!!! tip "Abbreviations"
    Introduce abbreviations in the text when they first appear. Thereafter, use
    only the abbreviation.

!!! tip "Numbers"
    Numbers from zero to ten are written with letters (i.e. one, two, three, etc).
    Numbers above ten (i.e. 11, 12, etc) are written with figures.

!!! tip "Avoid contractions"
    Replace "don't" with "do not", and so on.

!!! tip "Get some distance to your text"
    Before you hand in your text, give yourself some distance to it. Let
    it rest for a day, before you return to read it with fresh and critical eyes.

!!! tip "Grammar and spelling"
    Kör (stavnings- och) grammatik-kontroll på texterna som lämnas in.

!!! tip
    Go through the KTH checklists for the report:
    [Degree project checklist](https://www.kth.se/social/group/examensarbete-vid-cs/page/degree-project-checklist/) and
    [Formalities checklist](https://www.kth.se/social/group/examensarbete-vid-cs/page/formalities-checklist/)
