# Process

Below is a suggested process presented which aims to make the report writing
efficient.

## Define the idea and message
Initially define the idea and message that should be transmitted. The
message should obviously be based on the performed original research and the
results obtained (i.e. the unique contribution of the work).

There are several ways to reinforce the report's message:

* logical order
* repetition
* Organization

## Organization (high-level)
Identify the core sections of the report.

## Organization (low-level)
This is one of the most important steps.
Identify the low-level structure in each core section.
The process of dividing content into a skeleton is often very helpful for the
writing process, as the set structure serves as a guiding framework for writing.


This is
done by dividing and ordering the content into informative sections in order to
support the contribution (i.e. the original research) of the report.

## Recycle
Identify which parts of the project specification and the pre-study that can
be recycled for the report

## Bullet points and placeholders

Setting the structure helps to realize if the report tends to become too
complex/detailed/naive/premature/shallow.

## Iterate
Writing is dynamic process

## Feedback
