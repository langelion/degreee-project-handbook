# Report: Methodology

A scientific report should never present personal opinions or argue for
preconceived biases. Therefore the methodology section (sometimes
<i>"Methods"</i> or <i>"Materials and Methods"</i>) is a critical part of the
report, as it provides the information by which the validity of the study is
ultimately judged.

This section **focuses <u>only</u> on the technical aspects of the
procedure** necessary to answer the research question. While the procedure and
the different methods contained within are often justified elsewhere in the report
(e.g. in the Background section), the methodology section should provide enough
information so that:

* the audience can judge whether the results and conclusions are valid
* the experiment(s) could be repeated by the readers if they wish. This could
be in order to evaluate whether the results are reproducible, or prepare identical
material for further investigation.

This section is quite analogous to a recipe in a cookery book. It lists ingredients
and procedures but does not specify the use of particular equipment.

## Content
The methods section is typically the most straightforward part to write
as it simply describes **what was done, how it was done, in what order, and
how it was evaluated**. It should thus include a description of

* material (e.g. input data, hardware resources)
* procedures (e.g. algorithms, data processing, etc)
* evaluation approach (e.g. analysis/statistical tools)

The methods applied in the project are rarely new (if they were, they themselves
should be evaluated and justified in a scientific report). Thus, one can often
find literature where a particular method has been applied and described in
similar settings. Such references greatly facilitates the writing process of the
methods section.

##Tips

* Begin writing the methodology while performing/implementing experiments. (It
  is easy to forget details).

* If the procedure is complex or diverse, divide methods into subsections. Often,
the same subsections can often be applied in the ["Results" section](results.md).

* While writing, take notes on problems, issues, doubts, potential
  methodological improvements, that come to your mind. These notes will
  make a good framework for issues to discuss around in the
  ["Discussion" section](discussion.md) (e.g. strengths / weaknesses of the study).

* Order procedures chronologically or by type of procedure (subheaded) and
chronologically within type.

* Take inspiration from how others have written their methodology.

## Checklist

The methodology ...

* covers a description of material (e.g. input data and its characteristics),
description of methods, and analytical procedures (e.g. statistical tests), and
is organized chronologically.

* is written in past tense (it describes what <u>was</u> done).

* is written on a suitable technical level.

* describes and specifies the appropriate controls or comparators.

* clearly explains how all of the data in the Results section were obtained.

* does not show any results (only procedures) or include information that belong
in other sections.

* cites original research if the study uses methodologies described by others,

* clears any ethical concerns if applicable (e.g. that the study obtained
  appropriate ‘informed consent’ documents)

* allows other to repeat the same experiment given the same data.
