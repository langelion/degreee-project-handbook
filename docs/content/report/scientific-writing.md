# Scientific writing

A scientific report is aimed at exposing an idea and to present evidences in favor
of that idea. A good scientific report should therefore be clear and concise,
nuanced and well-argued, and to the point. It arrives at an answer to a specific
question, but also opens up for new questions.

To be able to write any text, including a scientific report, it is always
helpful to understand the readership. In contrast to most other literature,
scientific texts are rarely read linearly (page to page), but the experienced
scientific reader is usually very selective while reading and searches for the
parts that can be of most interest in order to quickly judge the relevance
of the work.

## Report structure

In order to facilitate selective reading, scientific reports are usually built
up from a common high-level structure (core structure). Although each report is
different, all of them follows a standard format and naturally share many
components and sections.

The **core structure** (high level structure) is made up by the fundamental
chapters/sections of the scientific report which are expected to be easily found
by the reader. Therefore they generally repeat from one report to another:

* [Introduction](introduction.md)
* [Background](background.md)
* [Methodology](methodology.md)
* [Results](results.md)
* [Discussion](discussion.md)
* [Conclusions](conclusions.md)

The core structure is rigid and disconnected from the topic of the report.
Although it may not represent the way/order in which science always happens, it
provides a standardized scope for original research and allows for non-linear
reading.

Given this structure, the report should start by providing the broad picture
(Introduction) and the more detailed background (theory and related work) that
justifies the methodology that has been chosen to answer the research question.
The report's unique contribution is then described (Methodology and Results),
which is finally discussed and contrasted to what was already known (Discussion
  and conclusion).

One often depicts the structure of a scientific report as an "hourglass"
([Mi&#353;ak et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jslw.2005.05.001)).

<pre>
       Go from the general, broad context of your work,
           to tell the reader what is already known,
                to what is not yet known or,
                   what the problems are,
                     to what you have
                         decided
                          to do

                    Methods and results
    (i.e. the original part of the study = contribution)

                           After
                        summarizing
                    the results, identify
                   limitations and biases,
                 compare and contrast them
              with previous findings and discuss
          theoretical and practical implications of your
         own, make cautious speculations and suggest future
      research, show what is new and how your results fit into
  the broad field you described at the  beginning of the introduction
</pre>

## Standard report components

Besides the common core sections (see above), all reports should also contain
the following components:

* [Title page](report-components.md#cover)
* [Abstract](report-components.md#abstract)
* [Table of contents](report-components.md#table-of-contents)
* [Bibliography](report-components.md#bibliography)
* Appendix [<i>optional</i>]
