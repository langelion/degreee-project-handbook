# Report components

Below are explained the fundamental components that are common to every report.

## Cover and title page
Before submitting the final report it should be wrapped by the official
KTH thesis cover to give it a uniform cover (back and front).
The cover is generated using this [online form](https://intra.kth.se/kth-cover?l=en).

<img id="presentations" title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="/assets/KTH_Master_ram.png" width="75%">

It is recommended to maintain the title page of the report template in order
to indicate the examiner and the supervisor(s) which do not show up on the
KTH cover page.

## Abstract

The abstract summarizes the report. It does so by being a condensed version of
the report's separate sections: Background, Methods, Results, and Conclusion.

### Background

* Provide the reader with a background to the study in a couple of sentences.
* Explain what is already known and what is not known about the subject.

### Methods

* Provide enough information to enable the reader to understand what was done and
how.

* Which method and evaluation measures were used?


### Results
This is the most important part of the abstract since it contains the findings
of the study. It should therefore be the longest part of the abstract.

### Conclusions
Finally, write down the most important take-home message of the study. It can
also include a short mentioning of the implications of the study.

<span style="background:yellow">Remember</span>: The abstract should be written
in both English and Swedish. Avoid to make the Swedish version a literal translation
of the English one, but try to write it in a natural language.

!!! tip
    Write the abstracts as the last component of the report. It has dependencies
    on all other core sections.

## Table of contents

The skeleton of a scientific report is its structure which is composed of main
sections and subsections. They should be organized in a logical order to
help reinforce the report's scientific contribution and story line.

It is important to have a balanced section structure. Only introduce subsections
if the main section (X) will contain at least two of subsections (e.g. X.1 and X.2).

<pre><code>
<span style="font-weight:bold">1 Introduction</span>
  <span style="color: red">1.1 Topic 1</span> (remove!)
<span style="font-weight:bold">2 Background</span>
  <span style="color: green">2.1 Topic 1</span>
  <span style="color: green">2.2 Topic 2</span>
  <span style="color: green">2.3 Topic 3</span>
</code></pre>

For the table of contents, it is highly recommended to

* auto-generate the table of contents in the text editor (don't write it manually),

* use the section titles to reinforce the report's message and reveal the story
line. For example, repeat key points (typically from the title and abstract) in
the section titles,

* make it easy to navigate between different parts of the report (add hyperlinks),

* assure that the structure is informative and concise (avoid being too detailed
or too condensed)

## Bibliography
The bibliography is the final section of the report and includes a complete list
of sources that were used to develop the research project. Complete citations
(including the author's name, the title, publisher, year pubilshed, page numbers,
URLs) should be listed for any in-text citation in the report. The latter should
provide a brief idea where the information to support a specific statement in the
report can be found.

There exist many different bibliographic styles for referencing and citing literature. Popular
styles for scientific reports include IEEE, ACM, Harvard, Chicago, APA, etc. The most
important is not which style to use, but to be consequent and stick to only one
throughout the report. This is easily achieved by letting the [reference manager](../prestudy/literature-search#reference-management) and/or text editor
(e.g. BibTeX) handle the generation of cited sources according to the selected
style.

* <b>ACM, APA</b>: Lists references alphabetically, using the author's last name.
* <b>IEEE</b>: Lists references numerically, in the order they have been cited.


Notice the difference in citing a journal article, internet resource, and book.
