# Report: Results

The Results section is often the shortest section of the report. Nevertheless,
it is the undisputed core and most important part of the report as **it presents
the data**, which from here on is **the new truth**. It is on these results that
the reader can form opinions and plan future research.

For that purpose, the results must be presented in a purely **objective manner**.
Subjective interpretation and discussion around the results are deferred until
the next section of the report (i.e. [Discussion section](discussion.md)).

## Structure

Before starting to write this section, think about

* what "story" does your data tell?
* which graphs, tables, and data are absolutely necessary for telling the story?
* which is the key graph/table for your work?

Make a deliberate choice early in the writing process on which key findings to present
in visuals (tables/figures).

Often the results section is **a mirror of the methods section**. For every method
(what you did), there should be a corresponding result (what you found) and vice
versa.

Finally, findings in the results section should match and answer the research
questions from the introduction

## Checklist

The result section

* contains both numerical data (figures/tables) AND narrative text that guide
the reader to the important results and connects results to each other,
* has a logical structure (i.e. starts with the simple results and builds up to
  the more complex results),
* is clearly written (in past tense),
* contains only data has been properly obtained and processed,
* contains <u>all</u> necessary result elements,
* does **not include** description of experimental methods,
* explains the findings objectively (i.e. does not include any interpretation or
  discussion of the data),

## Figures and tables

The key findings should be presented in tables and figures. There is usually no
need to do both for the same data. Only if the data is very complex it is
justified to present the same results in both figures and table format,

In general, each visual (figure/table) should

* be critical to the report,
* has a caption that explains it,
* be chronologically indexed and referenced in the narrative text,
* be carefully designed and prepared,
* be as self-explanatory as possible.

Formatting:

* All elements of the figure are viewable without zooming.
* The table/figure caption contains a label (e.g. Fig. 1), the title (e.g. "Principal component analysis of test data") and a narrative legend that describes the key features of the figure.
* Avoid titles in the figure itself, keep them in the caption.
* Axes have labels (physical quantity AND unit).
* Complex figures can be divided into panels (a,b,c, etc).
* Try to position the image AFTER where it was introduced in the text.
* Avoid screenshots. Export the graph in a proper format.
