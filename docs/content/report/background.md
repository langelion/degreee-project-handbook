# Report: Background

The background section should cover three areas:

* relevant theory
* related work (state-of-the-art)
* proposed methodology to answer the research question

Much of the content of the [pre-study](../prestudy/purpose) maps directly to
the background chapter.

## Checklist

The background section

* contains a description of the <u>relevant</u> theory necessary to
understand the concepts in the report,
* exposes the different and possible ways to answer the research question,
* relates past works to each other and to the current project,
* highlights what the important findings/methods are relative their own work,
* clearly justifies the chosen methodology,
* contains in-text citations (references) where statements need to be supported
by other sources of information,
* tells a coherent story with a logical flow.
