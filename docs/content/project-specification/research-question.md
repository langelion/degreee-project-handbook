# Research question and methods

!!! note "From the [course information](https://www.kth.se/social/group/examensarbete-vid-cs/page/specification-with-timetable/)"
    * The QUESTION that will be examined. Formulated as an explicit and evaluable question.
    * Specified problem definition (e.g. what does the assignment entail, what are the challenges involved?)
    * Examination method: Preliminary description of, for example, algorithms that will be tested, data that will be used
    * Expected scientific results: How is the work scientifically relevant and what is the hypothesis being tested? How is the hypothesis being tested?


The **research question** is at the core of the degree project. It guides and
centers the research by narrowing down the general research area to
a limited scope, and explicitly stating what the thesis will investigate and by
which means.

A well-composed research question helps to construct a logical argument for
a clear answer and conclusion (thesis statement) which in turn
help to reduce the possibility space to reach the thesis [objective](background-objective).

## Research methods

The empirical foundation of the project naturally shapes the research question,
and in applied research (engineering and technology) it is not uncommon that the
research methods themselves drive the research question formulation. Nevertheless,
it is much preferable that the question rather than the methods build the thesis.

Importantly, the project specification should account for a brief but motivated
description of the research methodology and the characteristics of the data
expected to be collected (e.g. type, dataset size, availability, accuracy,
completeness, etc). Specifically, it is necessary to explain how the research
question is supposed to be evaluated (by what means and given what circumstances).

## Research question
The research question should be:

* **focused** (narrow down the research topic so the question can be addressed within the allocated time),
* **clear and concise** (formulate a question that is short, sharp and to the point),
* **complex** (don't seek supporting evidence for preconceived ideas; don't ask unanswerable questions; don't formulate questions that can be answered with a simple YES or NO),
* **arguable** (the answer to the question should be interpretable and open for discussion),
* **interesting** (it should be of general interest and not only for researcher and the principal),
* (**measurable**).

### Process
It is not easy to ask the right question, and it is many times not known at the
beginning of the project. In order to develop and formulate a good research question:

1. Gather information on the broader topic to explore possibilities and to help
narrow down your topic to a limited scope.
2. Generate multiple candidate questions.
3. Estimate the equilibrium between complexity, feasibility, news value of each
candidate question. Can these parameters be controlled, e.g. by introducing
constraints?
4. Identify research **variables** involved in the study.
5. Consider characteristics of data (availability, type, size, accuracy, completeness, ...)
6. Select the best candidate question.
7. Formulate the research question. As its name suggests, research questions are
always written as questions. For example, start the research question with
"<i>What ...</i>", "<i>Does ...</i>", "<i>How ...</i>", "<i>To what extent ...</i>" etc.
A quantitative research question could follow this template:

    > Does **<i>x</i>** (name the theory) explain the relationship between
      **<i>y</i>** (independent  variable) and **<i>z</i>** (dependent variable),
      controlling for the effects of **<i>w</i>** (control variable)?

8. Ensure the research question is focused, clear, concise, complex, measurable,
and arguable.
9. Consider the path your answer might take and how to argue for the answer.
10. Continuously (re)evaluate and refine your research question. It is perfectly
normal to rewrite the research question many times until one settles on the final
formulation. Nevertheless, **being able to formulate a good research question
at an early stage of the project puts the researcher on a good way to write a strong thesis**.

One can at occasion need to formulate more than one question. In such case, make
sure that there is one main question, and that all questions relate to each other.
List the questions in order of relevance.

### Examples

Below are listed a few examples of M.Sc. research questions with comments.

!!! note "[Example](http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1230233/FULLTEXT01.pdf)"

    <i>"To what extent can autoencoders be used for feature extraction in the context of clothing images?"</i><br>

    **+** Specifies method (autoencoders), application (feature extraction), context (clothing images)<br>
    **-** Need to specify the autoencoders (e.g. type, number, etc).<br>
    **-** It is not clear how the success of feature extraction is measured.

!!! note "[Example](http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1219916/FULLTEXT01.pdf)"
    "<i>Will clustering algorithm X yield better in-cluster compactness when performed on the customer database
    than when performed on random data?</i>"

    **+** Clearly specifies which measure is to be used to evaluate the investigation (in-cluster compactness).<br>
    **-** Too tight connection to the principal's customer database. Try to generalize better.

!!! note "[Example](http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1273058/FULLTEXT01.pdf)"
    "<i>How well does a deep learning approach to predict diagnosis code for EHRs perform compared to Random Forest?"</i>"

    **+** Explains which measure to use to evaluate the answer.<br>
    **-** Improve focus by specifying the type of deep learning approach

!!! note "[Example](http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1249635/FULLTEXT01.pdf)"
    "<i>To what extent can machine learning be used to automatically appraise commercial real estate?</i>"

    **-** Improve focus: What machine learning are we talking about? How is success measured? What aspect of commercial real estate is considered?

### Advice

* It is usually more valuable to say something well-founded on a small problem
  than to speculate widely on a large but important problem.

* The examiner evaluates the thesis by comparing the outcome to the research
question. Keep in mind that while ambitious research questions may be attractive,
the student is only evaluated on what (s)he produces.

* It is not the topic itself that determines the quality of the research question.
  Rather, the important is that the question really allows you to elaborate a
  scientifically well-argued answer to the question.
