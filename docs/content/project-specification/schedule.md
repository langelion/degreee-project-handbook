# Conditions and schedule

!!! note "From the [course information](https://www.kth.se/social/group/examensarbete-vid-cs/page/specification-with-timetable/)"
    * List of the resources expected to be needed to solve the problem (unless the degree project involves investigating what equipment should be used). This can be technical equipment, but also experiment and interview subjects.
    * Defined limitations on what is to be done (so that it is clear what is not included in the degree project)
    * Collaboration with the principal (external supervisor). Describe the way in which the principal will be involved in the project and what the external supervisor has undertaken to do (e.g. in terms of discussion, implementation, report reading).
    * Schedule showing not only the order in which elements will be performed, but also the scope of elements and when they will be performed (calendar week number or date). The schedule should contain clear intermediate goals.

Limitations:

* Consider potential confidentiality issues from your principal. Remember that
 **the KTH examination is based solely on the report that is made public.**

!!! note "Confidentiality"

    If handling confidential data etc at the principal, note that:

    * All MSc thesis projects are public and published in Diva.
    * it is the public version of the thesis report that is assessed by the examiner.
    NO exceptions that the examiner sees e.g. an unmasked version. The public report must contain everything required to assess it (if the student wants to make another company-internal report with confidential details, this is fine, but this confidential report can not be the grounds for assessment)

Compose a time plan:

* List all possible tasks that need to be performed throughout the full degree
project (<span style="background:yellow">20 weeks</span>). Break up large tasks
into smaller tasks if appropriate.

* Schedule **important milestones** (control points; <span style="background:yellow">
do not forget to include revision time needed by the supervisor and/or the examiner</span>), e.g.
    * Deliver project specification
    * Deliver pre-study
    * Deliver half-time report
    * Deliver final report
    * Make oral presentation
    * Make opposition
    * Assist at two seminars (oral presenations by other students)
    * Research specific tasks (e.g. "training data is acquired")

* Identify and schedule **major tasks**, e.g
    * Prepare project specification
    * Perform literature search
    * Write pre-study
    * Execute research (<span style="background:yellow">specify subtasks!</span>)
    * Report writing
    * Prepare and assay presentation

* Additional [complimentary tasks](#).

* Estimate how much devotion each task requires (in weeks), or when in time the
milestones should be achieved. For the oral presentation and oppostion, see
[figure](#presentations) for an indication of when students typically present
their work throughout the year.

* The time dedicated to solve the problem (i.e. implementation phase) should
typically not exceed 50% of the total time dedicated to the degree project.

* Lay out all above tasks in a time chart ([Gannt charts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart) are popular)
and in a logical order. Tasks can run in parallel with each other (for example
the **report writing** should run in parallel to other tasks).

* Prepare for unforeseen situations and add compensation time towards the end.

* Ambition is admired in a research project. The implementation plan, however,
should be **realistic**. <span style="background: yellow">It is the responsibility
of the student to inform the supervisor if the execution of the time plan is
delayed more than two weeks</span>.

!!! note "Ideal time schedule"
    - present around midsummer (week before or after) which means that
    - the coordinator needs to schedule the presentation by mid-June,
    - the examiner needs to get the presentation report in early June (around first week of June, check with your examiners)
    - the supervisor need to get the presentation report some time during the
    second half of May in order to be able to iterate it with the student.

    Definition: “presentation report” = a report that is more or less finished, but
    does not need to be the final version. It should be in such a state that the
    examiner can assess it favourably and that an opponent can make a good
    review on it.
