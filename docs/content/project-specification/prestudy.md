# Pre-study

!!! note "From the [course information](https://www.kth.se/social/group/examensarbete-vid-cs/page/specification-with-timetable/)"
    Description of the literature studies. What areas will the literature study focus on?
    How shall the necessary knowledge on background and state-of-the-art be obtained?
    What preliminary important references have been identified?

The pre-study is a **key project component** which outcome should

* justify the choice of research methods and evaluation measures,
* provide support for a thorough discussion around the results of the project,
* typically correspond to a separate chapter in the final report (background)
that introduces concepts, methods, as well as previous/related works.

For the purpose of the project specification:

* Read about the pre-study [here](../prestudy/general) and make sure its role
for the project is clear.

* Identify the **key words** that describe your research question and that
can be used for literature search.

* List which are the sections that need to be covered in the pre-study (e.g.
  concepts, methods, theories, related works).

* If relevant, list the most seminal works and leading scientists in your field(s).

* Plan to retrieve information from both **regular journal articles** and **review articles**.
    * The former include <i>data-driven papers</i>, <i>method papers</i>,
    <i>tutorial papers</i>, and <i>theoretical papers</i>. They can all be used to
    define and justify your methods.
    * The latter are used to get an overview of the field, and contextualize your work.

* Estimate that the <span style="background: yellow">pre-study requires
four to six weeks of full-time work</span>.
