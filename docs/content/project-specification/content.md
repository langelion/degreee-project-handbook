The project specification should cover the areas listed below (as listed in the [course information](https://www.kth.se/social/group/examensarbete-vid-cs/page/specification-with-timetable/)).

* Background and objective
* Research question and methods
* Evaluation and news value
* Pre-study
* Conditions and time schedule

The format is free. Nevertheless,
<span style="background-color: yellow">large parts of the project specification
relate to the introductory chapter(s) of the final report.</span>

In principle, the specification is best considered as <span style="background-color: yellow">
a dynamic and living document</span> that is continuously updated and adjusted
as the project progresses.
