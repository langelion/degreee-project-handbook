#Project specification checklist

* Objectives: at two different levels (principal and student)

* The answer to the research questions connects back to the thesis objective

* se till att ditt arbete i slutänden blir allmängiltigt, dvs du ska utreda en vetenskaplig fråga av allmänt intresse, inte göra ett beställningsjobb åt Mentimeter.

* Is the research question one that is of interest to the researcher and potentially to others?  

* Is it a new issue or problem that needs to be solved or is it attempting to shed light on previously researched topic.

* Is the research question researchable?  Consider the available time frame and the required resources.  
* Is the methodology to conduct the research feasible?
* Is the research question measureable and will the process produce data that can be supported or contradicted?
* Is the research question too broad or too narrow?
* Check A1.2.
