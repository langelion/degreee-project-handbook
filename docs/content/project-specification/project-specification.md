# Project specification

The **project specification** is a written document that presents and plans the
research to be performed. Importantly, it

* defines the [research question](#research-question-and-methods),
* defines the [research methodology](#research-question-and-methods) to answer above question,
* contextualizes the research question and methodology, and motivates its relevance based on current knowledge (**state-of-the-art**)
* defines and schedules key tasks (milestones)
* defines deliverables that can be used to measure project progress

The specification sets the stage for the research to be performed. It is later
used to measure project progress against the proposed schedule, milestones, and
deliverables. Finally, it constitutes the core material for the 'Introduction'
chapter of the final report.

!!! note "How is the project specification different from the project proposal?"
    The project specification is a **significant extension and deepening** of the
    project proposal. It should carefully validate the research question and methodology against
    scientific literature, as well as list potential complications and important
    constraints.

    A well-prepared specification **will save you much time, effort and resources.**

!!! note "IMPORTANT"
    It is the responsibility of the student to inform the supervisor on the work
    progress. A specific reasons to contact the supervisor is **if the specification
    must be changed**.

## Content
The project specification can take different shape and structure, but should cover
the areas listed below (as listed in the [course information](https://www.kth.se/social/group/examensarbete-vid-cs/page/specification-with-timetable/)).

### Background and objective

> * Description of the area within which the degree project is carried out
  (e.g. connection to research/development, state-of-the-art, scientific and/or societal interest)
  * The principal's interest. The background of the specific assignment to be conducted
  * Objective. What is the desired outcome?
  (From the principal's side, and from the perspective of the degree project)

Position the degree project in an **academic** context.

* <i>What is its research territory</i>? Explain by introducing relevant previous
research in the field (i.e. state-of-the-art).

* <i>What concerns/questions/problems exist in the current context</i>? This
defines your "niche" in the academic and/or R&D context.

* <i>What is the objective (aim)</i>? It explains **why** one wants to answer the [research question](#research-question-and-method). What will the answer be used for?

!!! note "Objectives"
    The degree project objective is typically a smaller part of the principal's objective.

    For example, consider <i>an e-commerce recommendation system</i>. The
    **principal's objective** could be to "increase customer conversions (paying
    transactions) by improving the relevance of the displayed products
    for each individual customer". Similarly, the **thesis objective** could be
    to "evaluate which learning model performs best on a given test set".


### Research question and methods
> * The QUESTION that will be examined. Formulated as an explicit and evaluable question.
  * Specified problem definition (e.g. what does the assignment entail, what are the challenges involved?)
  * Examination method: Preliminary description of, for example, algorithms that will be tested, data that will be used
  * Expected scientific results: How is the work scientifically relevant and what is the hypothesis being tested? How is the hypothesis being tested?


**The research question** is at the core of your project. The quality of it will
decide the quality of your project. Therefore, work HARD to define the exact
question that you want to address.

Some advice:

* It is **IMPORTANT** that the research question is well-defined and well formulated.

* The research question should be of general interest (and not only aimed for the principal).

* Narrow down the research question to a very limited area. Introduce constraints,
but always explain their reasons.

* It is not the topic itself that determines the quality of the research question.
Rather, the important is that the question really allows you to elaborate a
scientifically well-argued answer to the question.

* Include all necessary elements in the research question. For example, it is
usually not feasible to state the question without mentioning somehow what methods
are to be used.

* Related to above point, already when formulating the question one should consider
how to argue for the answer.

* The research question should also somehow reflect the empirical foundation of
the project.

* Continuously (re)evaluate your research question. It is perfectly normal to
have to rewrite it many times until one settles on the final formulation.

* It is not easy to ask the right question. While you need appropriate sources
to state your question, it should be the question rather than the sources that
build the thesis.

* The answer to the research question should reduce the possibility space to
reach the objective.

* One can formulate > 1 question. If so, make sure that there is one clear main
question, and that all questions relate to each other.


!!! note "REMEMBER 1"
    It is usually more valuable to say something well-founded on a small problem
    than to speculate widely on a large and socially important problem.

!!! note "REMEMBER 2"
    The natural way for the examiner to evaluate the written thesis is to compare
    its outcome with the research question. Keep in mind that while ambitious
    research questions may be attractive, you are only evaluated on what you produce.

!!! note "REMEMBER 3"
    At rare occasion, the research question will be completely reformulated when
    the project finishes (depends on the analysis of the collected material).
    We shall try to avoid this though.

!!! warning
    Don't:

    * seek supporting evidence for a preconceived idea
    * ask an unanswerable question
    * ask a useless question

Engineering students often have a quite clear idea of the **research methods**
they will use when they start their project. Often the research question is
formulated based on the available methods.

It is important that all **research methods** are mentioned and motivated with
respect to literature (state-of-the-art) and the project context.

!!! note "IMPORTANT"
    If the methods require training datasets from external part, it is highly
    recommended that the student acquires them as early as possible.

If an **hypothesis** exists, it should preferentially be mentioned in close connection
to the research question. Give brief background on how the hypothesis has been
generated, and what assumptions have been made that can support it.


### Evaluation and news value
> * Evaluation. How is it determined if the objective of the degree project has been fulfilled and if the question has been adequately answered?
  Include preliminary report on the evaluation method, measures, and data.
  * The work's innovation / news value. Why does someone want to read the finished work? Who are these people?

It is <u>necessary</u> to mention how the results obtained using the methods shall
be **evaluated**. For example, if one compare two methods with each other, or compare
the results from one method to some reference data, it is also important to
think over and mention how these comparisons shall be interpreted and analyzed.
Is the evaluation qualitative or quantitative? In the latter case, does the
methodology generate data suitable for statistical analysis? Which statistical
methods will be used?

Make sure that the **news value** of your thesis is high also for people outside
the principal's environment.

!!! note "News value"
    Think about how you can increase the news value of your thesis?


### Pre-study
> Description of the literature studies. What areas will the literature study focus on?
  How shall the necessary knowledge on background and state-of-the-art be obtained?
  What preliminary important references have been identified?

Some advice:

* Identify the **key words** that describe your research question and that
can be used for literature search

* Who are the leading scientists in the field? What and where do they publish
their studies?

* Retrieve information from both **regular journal articles** and **review articles**.
The former include <i>data-driven papers</i>, <i>method papers</i>,
<i>tutorial papers</i>, and <i>theoretical papers</i>.
They can all be used to define and justify your methods. The latter are used to get an overview of the field, and contextualize your work.

* Explore and make use of the [resources](https://www.kth.se/en/kthb/kurser-och-stod/stod/handledning-i-inform) at your library

### Conditions and schedule
> * List of the resources expected to be needed to solve the problem. E.g. technical equipment, experiments, interview objects.
  * Defined limitations on what is to be done. (so that it is clear what is not included in the degree project)
  * Collaboration with the principal (external supervisor). Describe the way in which the principal will involved in the project and what this person has undertaken to do
  * Schedule

Limitations:

* Consider potential confidentiality issues from your principal. Remember that
 **the KTH examination is based solely on the report that is made public.**

Some advice on schedule:

* List all possible tasks you imagine that you will need to perform throughout
 the full degree project. Among other tasks, consider also these [suggested tasks](until-next-time#suggested-actions).

* Break up tasks into smaller tasks if possible

* Define **milestones** and **deliverables**
  > A <i>milestone</i> is a **control point** that helps to keep track of the progress.
  It represents the completion of a major step in the project that requires the
  commitment of a certain amount of time, resources and effort. <br>
  Example: <i>the training dataset has been acquired</i>; <i>research data is collected</i>;
  <i>"powerpoint" for final presentation is ready</i>
  <br><br>
  > A <i>deliverable</i> is the output of a task (and is typically expressed as
  a noun). Deliverables<br>
  Example: <i>assignment</i>; <i>mid-term report</i>; <i>any project specific task...</i>

* Lay out tasks, milestones, deliverables in a time chart ([Gannt charts](https://www.google.se/search?q=gantt+chart&dcr=0&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjNl8KC6O3YAhUSJVAKHe2QAn4Q_AUICigB&biw=1245&bih=901) are popular) where you prioritize
key tasks.


* Tasks may perfectly well run in parallel with each other.

!!! note "Parallel tasks"
    The **report writing** SHOULD run in parallel to other tasks. Don't save it to
    the end when all other tasks are finished. Writing should be a continuous
    process that should start immediately, and that is finished off when the task
    is solved.


* Ambition is admired in a research project. The implementation plan, however,
should be **realistic**. Don't over-charge your work plan, nor rush from one task to
another. Instead, be honest with yourself, and organise your time and
responsibilities in a reasonable manner.

* Think about how the time plan could break by unforeseen situations, and what
you could do about it.

* Be flexible, and add compensation time towards the end.

!!! note "IMPORTANT"
    It is the responsibility of the student to inform the supervisor if the
    execution of the time plan is delayed > 2 weeks.

## General writing tips

!!! tip "Read, read, read"
    Spend significant time to find and read **high-quality literature** relevant for
    your research topic. It will help you to choose your methods and to narrow down
    your research question.

!!! tip "Writing is a continuous process"
    **A good project description is not written in one day.** It has to mature.
    Therefore, create a draft on the very first day, and then continuously edit it
    (add/remove/change/reconsider) until you hand it in.

!!! tip "Get some distance to your text"
    Before you hand it in, give your self some distance to your specification. Let
    it rest for a day, before you return to read it with fresh and critical eyes.

!!! tip "Learn from previous thesis works"
    Use the [library](https://www.kth.se/kthb) to find [published engineering master's theses](http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/search.jsf?dswid=-6704).
    Explore many theses, both in your own and in other fields.

    * What common structure do they all share?
    * Are the research questions stated implicitly or explicitly?
    * How have the students narrowed down their research question?
    * Focus on the introductory chapters. How do they relate to Assignment 1?
