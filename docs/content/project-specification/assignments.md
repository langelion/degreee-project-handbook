# Assignment A1

Assignment A1 concerns the [**project specfication**](purpose).

## Prerequisite
Approved project proposal (by examiner).

## Tasks
The process is divided into five stages (A1.0 - A1.4).

***
<span id="A1_0">**A1.0 - Evaluate your group members' project proposals**</span>

1. Read the project proposals from **all** your group members.

2. For each proposal, describe in **one sentence** what the most important
graph of the final report could look like. For example,

    * what could the title be?
    * which will be variables on the axes?
    * could it include statistical error bars?

3. Send the sentences for each proposal to the academic supervisor (label each sentence with the title of the proposal).
4. Within short you will receive your peers' comments on your own proposal.
Treat them as **an indicator** of how clear the research part of your project proposal is.

***
<span id="A1_1">**A1.1 - Plan and structure the project specification**</span>

1. Contemplate what you learned from A1.0.
    * What did your peers do well in their project proposals? Did you pick up any
    ideas that you could use for your own project?
    * Are your peers' comments on your own proposal in line with your own ideas
    about your project?
    * Adapt your specification accordingly.

2. Read carefully the detailed requirements of the project specification from
both the official [course information](https://www.kth.se/social/group/examensarbete-vid-cs/page/specification-with-timetable/)
and the [degree project handbook](purpose).

3. Elaborate a <u>coarse-grained draft</u> of the project specification. The
draft should outline the core of the project description:
    * What sections will it contain, and what information will be contained in each section?
    * Outline all important [compulsory events and tasks for the project](../project-specification/schedule) and fit them into a time schedule.
    * Focus on content rather than style (e.g. work with bullet
      points to list the requested information).
    * Work hard on formulating the research question according to the [guidelines](../project-specification/research-question).
    * Include a **"Formalities"** section with the preliminary title, student's
    name and email, academic supervisor, principal and supervisor at the
    principal's workplace (name and email), and date for last update.


4. Send the draft to the academic supervisor. Remember, it does not have to be perfect.

***
<span id="A1_2">**A1.2 - Write the project specification**</span>

1. Consider any feedback on the draft (A1.1) from the supervisor.
2. Write the project specification in its final form (content AND style). It
should be well-written and grammatically correct.
3. Make sure that the external supervisor (at the principal) reads and approves
   the specification.
3. Send the specification to the academic supervisor.


***
<span id="A1_3">**A1.3 - Peer-reviewing**</span>

Soon after you have sent in your project specification (i.e. A1.2), you will
receive a project specification written by one of your peer-students. Your task
is to provide [constructive feedback](../general/peer-reviewing#constructive-feedback)
on it.

**Useful resources**: handbook notes on [peer-reviewing](../general/peer-reviewing) and
[project specification](purpose)

The format is free, but your feedback should help to assure that ...

* the research question is formulated according to the [recommendations](../project-specification/research-question). In brief,
    1. well-defined and clearly formulated,
    2. challenging,
    3. of broad interest (i.e. not only for the student and the principal).

* it is plausible to answer the research question ...
    1. with the proposed methodology,
    2. using scientific arguments,
    3. within the proposed time.

Does the project specification

* indicate that a solid base of scientific literature exist for research area?
* provide enough information for you to answer the question in assignment **A1.0**?

Send the feedback to the corresponding student + the academic supervisor.

***
<span id="A1_4">
**A1.4 - Revision**
</span>

Address the feedback received on the project specification from your peer and
send it to supervisor.

!!! tip
    Did you find something useful in your peer-student's project specification
    that you could implement in your own specification?
    It could be particular references, ways to express ideas, examples, etc...

***


## Deadlines
* **A1.0: ~1 day**. Send your answers to your academic supervisor who compiles
and returns them to the each student.
* **A1.1: ~1 week**
* **A1.2: ~2 weeks**
* **A1.3: ~1 day**
* **A1.4: ~1 day** Send your final specification to the academic supervisor.

Recommendation: Aim to have the specification ready within two to three weeks after the project
has started.
## Evaluation

The project specification forms part of the final evaluation of the course.

The examiner approves the final specification (**PASS or FAIL**) based on the
following criteria:
  > A realistic and thorough specification has been developed by the student.
  The student understands the task and the environment where it will be performed well.
