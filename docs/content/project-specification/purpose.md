# Purpose
The **project specification** presents a plan for the research to be performed.
A well prepared project specification is fundamental for a successful project,
as it

* defines the [research question](#research-question-and-methods),
* exposes the [research methodology](#research-question-and-methods)
that will be used to answer above question,
* defines important constraints and challenges,
* identifies and schedules key tasks (milestones and deliverables) that can be
used to measure project progress.

Importantly, the project specification contextualizes and justifies both
the research question and methodology based on the current scientific knowledge
(**state-of-the-art**).
