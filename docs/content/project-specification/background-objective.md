# Background and objective

!!! note "From the [course information](https://www.kth.se/social/group/examensarbete-vid-cs/page/specification-with-timetable/)"
    * Description of the area within which the degree project is carried out
    (e.g. connection to research/development, state-of-the-art, scientific and/or societal interest)
    * The principal's interest. The background of the specific assignment to be conducted
    * Objective. What is the desired outcome?
    (From the principal's side, and from the perspective of the degree project)

The project specification should position the degree project and its
[research question](research-question) in a **social** and **academic** context
that:

* clarifies why the selected research topic is unique and relevant,
* explains how the degree project relates to the current knowledge frontier
(**state-of-the-art**),
* describes any possible economic, social, ecological, and ethical aspects,
* describes the settings for the project (e.g. the principal and special conditions),

Above points help to formulate the **aim** / **objective(s)**, i.e. the overall
intention of the project. The aim should explain **why** one wants to answer
the [research question](research-question) and what the answer will be used for. <span style="background-color: yellow">Note that often the project objective is only a minor part of the
principal's objective.</span>

> For example, consider an <i>e-commerce recommendation system</i>. While the
  **principal's objective** could be "to increase customer conversions (paying
  transactions) by improving the relevance of the displayed products for each
  individual customer", the **thesis objective** could be "to evaluate which
  learning model performs best on a given data set".
