# Evaluation and news value

!!! note "From the [course information](https://www.kth.se/social/group/examensarbete-vid-cs/page/specification-with-timetable/)"
    * Evaluation. How is it determined if the objective of the degree project has been fulfilled and if the question has been adequately answered? Preliminary report on the evaluation method, measures and data.

    * The work's innovation/news value. Why does someone want to read the finished work? And who are these people?

It is <u>necessary</u> to mention how the results obtained using the methods shall
be **evaluated**. For example, if one compare two methods with each other, or compare
the results from one method to some reference data, it is also important to
think over and mention how these comparisons shall be interpreted and analyzed.
Is the evaluation qualitative or quantitative? In the latter case, does the
methodology generate data suitable for statistical analysis? Which statistical
methods will be used?

Make sure that the **news value** of your thesis is high also for people outside
the principal's environment.
